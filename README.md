# CALA Code Challenge

This is a simple programming assignment; create a JavaScript application
that runs in the browser and renders a calendar for the current month. Here's an
example of the result we expect:

## Guidelines

- The arrow buttons on the left and right should move to the previous and next
  months, respectively.
- Use plain JavaScript; no jQuery, React, or other libraries.
 Don't worry about browser compatibility (just make sure it renders in the latest version of Google Chrome).
- Don't be too concerned with responsive behavior. We won't judge if it doesn't look great on mobile.

## Evaluation

- Your work will be graded on correctness. Does the calendar render properly?
- We'll look for maintainability. Could someone come along in 6 months and easily make changes?
- Upgradability is important, too. Could your work be easily extended into a more complex calendaring project?
